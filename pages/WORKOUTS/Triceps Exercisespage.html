            <p><b>This move—also known as a lying triceps extension—hammers two of the three heads of the triceps: the long and lateral heads. 
                The most popular version is performed on a flat bench with the elbows locked over the head (hence the name),
                 but it's also great on a decline or incline bench. It also works with a wide variety of resistance including not only an EZ-bar, but also dumbbells, cables, or even the Smith machine.</b></p>

                Perform this movement first or second in your workout. Do 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps. If you're going heavy, don't hesitate to use wrist wraps for extra support.

            <p><b>Dips are a proven mass-builder on their own. Their only problem: Lots of people can't do enough reps to get within the ideal muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps. Either that, or they can do way too many. In the former case, use the assisted dip/pull-up machine or a band. In the latter, add weight with a dip belt or a light dumbbell between your knees or feet.

                Dips hit both the chest and triceps, but to favor the tris, keep your body as vertical as possible. Don't lean forward and keep those elbows tight to your sides. Think dips won't work for you? Take a look at any male gymnast; horseshoe triceps come standard issue with all those dips!</b></p>

            <p><b>Another dip? Yep. EMG evidence suggests that there's substantial triceps activation during a bench dip. How can you make this classic calisthenics move even better? By bumping up the load with added weight!

                The best and safest way to load up is to have a partner place weights across your lap. Intensity boosters like dropsets are easy to do: just remove a plate to extend your set.</b></p>

                    <mark>Pro tip: Many trainees mess up here by failing to go to full triceps extension and stopping short of fully bending their elbows. Your triceps are elbow extenders, so perform the full range of motion.</mark></b></p>

                <p><b>Take a look at the bench press and you'll notice that the last two-thirds of the movement is mostly elbow extension—in other words, triceps. This is one reason why super strong pressers prioritize triceps training and love the board press to do it.

                    The board press is a partial-rep version of the bench press where you place 2x4s on your chest to preferentially train the lockout. Don't have boards? An easier gym hack may be simply to move a bench inside the rack and set the pins a few inches off your chest.</b></p>

                <p><b>Once your arms go overhead, the long head of the triceps gets prioritized. This head is difficult to target otherwise, which is why it's always a good idea to include some kind of overhead exercise in your triceps workout.

                        Traditional push-ups are usually done with the hands just outside of shoulder width to allow the pecs to do most of the work. But bringing your hands in and tucking your elbows can produce greater muscle activity in both the triceps and the pecs.</b></p>
