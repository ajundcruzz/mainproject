            <p><b>Bench presses can be used to increase strength, improve endurance, and tone the muscles of the upper body, including the chest, arms, and shoulders.1 to 3 times per week could help optimize strength gains.

                However, the number of times that you should perform a bench press per week depends on your personal goals and fitness routine.
                
                Some may prefer performing bench presses only once per week. Others may find that adding it to their routine more frequently, such as 3 to 4 times per week, works better for them.
                
                For best results, be sure to perform bench presses on nonconsecutive days so that your muscles have a chance to fully recover.</b></p>

            <p><b>Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is an age-old weight-room debate. Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation has more versatility throughout the beginning, middle, and end of a chest workout.

                Some other big plusses for dumbbells: Each side's musculature must work independently, creating more balanced strength and size. Dumbbells also allow a longer range of motion, which some studies say can lead to muscle growth. Plus, you can more easily tweak your grip to create variety and a new stimulus on chest day.</b></p>

            <p><b>The common thinking on decline is that it's for lower chest only.

                <p><b>Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but machine press and cable press variations have some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets.

                    Feel like a step down from free weights? It shouldn't. EMG research demonstrates that the machine bench press recruits the shoulders far less than free-weight variations. This allows you to really target your pecs.</b></p>

                <p><b>An obvious point in favor of push-ups is that they require no equipment and can be the centerpiece of a home chest workout,Sets of push-ups to failure are a great way to burn out or add volume in the late stages of a workout, and they're awesome in a compound set with dips, a mechanical dropset after flyes or presses,
                     or an antagonist chest-and-back superset with rows. Weighted push-ups and push-ups with resistance bands can even be a primary push movement, if needed.</b></p>

                <p><b>Dips were a staple in the training programs of the golden-age greats for good reason: Nothing stretches the chest and makes it work quite like this bodyweight movement.
                     You can add extra weight with a dip belt if you're seriously strong, or use band or machine assistance if you struggle with bodyweight reps.
                      Plus, they are a great spotter-free alternative to the decline press.
                    All types of dips hit the chest heavily, but on chest day, it's worth making sure you're doing dips that emphasize the pecs. Put your feet up behind you, lean forward as far as possible, and allow your elbows to flare out slightly as you dip.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Pull-overs have been a favorite torso builder of bodybuilders for decades. Dating back to the 1940s and earlier, lifters alternated them with 20-rep squats in workouts designed to expand the ribcage.
                         The logic behind this approach may not stand up today, but the move is still worth including on a modern chest day.
                        Lean toward the incline version, which puts your chest fibers under tension for a longer range of motion. Use a bench that's 30-45 degrees and keep your elbows in a fixed comfortable angle. The more they bend and flex, the more this becomes a triceps movement.
                        Do pull-overs at the very end of your workout for sets of around 12 reps. On every set,
                         hold the peak contraction of the last rep for a full 5 seconds..</b></p>

                    <p><b>For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka, pec-deck) is a more effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. 
                        If your gym has one,it's a great move to get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk.
                        As a pre-exhaust, hit a few sets of 10-15 before your presses.As a burnout, hit the machine fly last in your routine for sets of around 10-12. Experiment with dropsets, partial reps, and other intensity boosters. Don't be afraid to take this movement to failure, and know that you've earned your post-workout protein shake.</b></p>
